This project was inspired by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations as listed here https://sdgs.un.org/goals. We mainly focused on goal number 3; Good health and well being. Burden off aims to provide a place where someone is able to share his problems with volunteer validated proffesionals who will be able to provide help. BurdenOff will also be a place for psychology proffesionals with free time and good will to use their expertise to help troubled members of our global commuinity. 

The proccess is simple; create an account post your problem and wait. An expert will see your post and invite you to a private session. There you will be able to talk to the expert that chose you and try and find some peace of mind. If you are open to it you can chose to set your problem as public, that means that your initial post and ONLY the final solution that the expert gives,not the private session, will be open to the public in hopes of maybe helping someone with a proble similar to your own.

Technical Details:
