                                           --Burden Off--
This project was inspired by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations as listed here https://sdgs.un.org/goals. We mainly focused on goal number 3; Good health and well being. Burden Off aims to provide a place where someone can freely share their problems with volunteer validated professionals who will be able & willing to provide help. Burden Off will also be a place for psychology professionals with free time and good will to use their expertise to help troubled members of our global commuinity. 
                      
The proccess is simple; create an account, post your problem and wait. An expert will see your post and invite you to a private session. There, you will be able to talk to the expert that chose you and try and find some peace of mind. If you are open to it you can choose to set your problem as public; that means that your initial post and only the final solution that the expert gives, not the private session, will be open to the public in hopes of helping someone with a problem similar to your own.

Technical Details: 
In order to create this website we mainly used React and Bootstrap for the Front-end, and Express for the Back-end and the connection with our SQL database. For the safe storage of passwords within the database we used the npm library Bcrypt. A complete list of the packages we used can be found in the appropriate package.json files.


This project was made by four proud undergraduate students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Vasilis Christoforidis, Sotirios Karbounis, Dimitrios Kostakis, Giannis Kostakis and under the guidance of their professor Ms. Athina Vakali.
